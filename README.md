# City Explorer

## Author: Tricia Sawyer

This project is my first that implements a backend server for a website, using API's that allow a user to request a map of a cities location with weather information, movies that contain that cities name, and restaurants near that area.

### Getting Started

- Install packackes with the command `npm init`.
